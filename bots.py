Of course, there could be a middle ground between “absolute non-person making things up” and “personal representative of the emperor.” The Polos were merchants. They were from a far off place, they followed a novel religion, and they represented trade. Kublai Khan was interested in all of that. So while Polo may not have had a position at court and acted as an agent of the emperor, it’s not implausible that he would have been presented to him at least once.

A great example of this is with solids and gases: If you imagine the atoms or molecules in a solid block of ice, they will be very orderly and will have a fairly consistent organization. As you increase the temperature, the block of ice melts to liquid, and the system becomes more disordered as the molecules flow more easily. And then when you increase the temperature more, the molecules will gain more energy, allowing them to become much more disordered since they will be farther away from other molecules than in the solid or liquid forms. Thus you can imagine how as you go from solid to gas, disorder increases.'''}

The Soviets scored the first goal which was equalized by Buzz Schneider and the second goal was equalized by Mark Johnson, rather controversially.

Policies: The question of what specific policies will be enacted is where the scientists (political, economic, social, & natural) fight it out with people who have something to lose if things change. It is where empirical data meets motivated reasoning.

Enactment/Execution: The question of how policies will be enacted shows up in three major aspects of how government operates: (1) form of government, (2) norms of governance, and (3) tone of discourse. Of these, the form of government is probably the easiest to classify and understand - we can look at a specific government and see whether or not laws are codified; we can observe whether or not people have a meaningful vote; we can see whether people vote directly on issues, or whether they delegate most of their enactment power to legislative representatives.'''}

When there is only one particle, we can superpose states and we do not get entanglement. When there is more than one particle, an entangled state is a superposition of unentangled states.

For example, if two particles are emitted with equal and opposite spin and measured by Alice and Bob, as in the EPR experiment, the quantum state is a superposition of states with opposite spin, meaning that if Alice finds spin-up, Bob will find spin-down and if Bob finds spin-up, Alice will find spin-down. The state is said to be entangled. Whoever performs their measurement “first” determines the result of the other measurement. If the measurements are outside the light cone, there is strictly no meaning of “first”. According to special relativity, different observers will regard different measurements as being first according to different conventions of synchroneity.

The reason for entanglement is that particles are not separated by human conceptions of space and time, but by interactions, or rather by lack of interaction, with each other and surrounding matter. The entangled state does not exist in a reality of time and space, but in an abstract mathematical configuration space describing human knowledge.'''}

First, even adding two one-digit numbers may take thousands of individual brain operations, because you have to recall your addition tables and whatnot.

Triple junctions are typically formed when a plume hits a tectonic plate. The push from the plume uplifts the plate and eventually “ruptures” it. Typically, three ruptures or “arms” will form at 120 degrees from one another. From the potential energy due to the uplift, these arms eventually form normal fault systems, and spread to form spreading plate margins (rifts). New oceanic crust is formed in these spreading arms, as the mantle decompresses under the plate, and erupts basaltic magma.

However, one of these three arms stop spreading after the initial phase and becomes the “failed arm”. The Great African Rift is the failed arm in this triple junction. The spreading arms are the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Geochemical signatures of multiple plumes, originating from deep mantle, have been identified from the EAR rocks.

An analogy can be seen when milk is boiled with a thin film on top. The film breaks along three lines at approximately 120 degrees from one another. After a while, the film starts shifting outward along two of those lines, while the third line remains in place.'''}

                However, there are a few things to take into account when you are talking about exceptionally intelligent people.

                First, you have the fact that Einstein's children, obviously, also have a mother, and therefore inherited their IQs from her as well. Now, Mileva Marić, Einstein's wife, was also pretty smart. In fact, she contributed to some of Einstein's work. But assuming she was less smart than Einstein, that would have been a factor driving the children's IQs down.

                Secondly, there is the concept of regression towards the mean. What this tells us is that if both your parents are exceptional in a certain respect, you will probably be exceptional in that respect as well but not as much as your parents.

                However, since you asked about supplements, the most important ones for preventing soreness include the following in prioritized order:

                1. Whey protein
                2. Creatine
                3. BCAAs (branch chain amino acids)

                Whey protein is proven, scientifically to have the highest absorption rate and delivery of protein to muscle cells immediately post-exercise. You should make sure to pair protein with a carbohydrate as well because both are needed for muscle synthesis.

                Creatine is an amazing substance which is naturally occurring in many meats. It works by drawing water into your muscle cells which is, in itself, an anabolic agent. Having additional water in the muscle cells helps with a multitude of physiological processes, including recovery.

                BCAAs are branch-chain amino acids. Taking BCAAs at strategic points throughout the day will significantly reduce delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) from high-intensity eccentric training. Researchers found a 64 percent decrease in muscle soreness at 72 hours following exercise from BCAAs compared to a placebo. The exercise consisted of 12 sets of 10 eccentric repetitions at 120% of 1RM. If those loading parameters don't produce insanely nasty levels of muscle soreness, nothing will!

                Take all three of these supplements: Whey protein immediately after your workout. Creatine - at any time of day, but regularly as it isn't an acute response. BCAAs during your workout. I guarantee you'll be able to workout more regularly and with less soreness. I think glutamine is overrated.'''}

                1. Take great pleasure in your work. Enjoy the pleasure of journey more than just the destination. Great artists, great warriors and great scientists do what they do because the process of creation itself is so pleasurable for them. 

                2. Life is all about managing the emotions: A good chunk of Gita is about managing emotions and attachment. Panic and emotional attack can be a real killer in a lot of professions from warring to investing. 

                3. Never imitate another's life: A warrior could see the farmer's life as peaceful and happy. A peasant could see the warrior's life as energetic and active. 

                4. Never lose sight of your goals because of imitation: Stuck by confusion we give up our dreams and goals so that we could be a better somebody (a modern example is think of Facebook statuses & peer pressures). We are kept from our goal, not by obstacles, but by a clear path to a lesser goal.

                5. Treat everyone and everything the same. Gita spends a chapter about how to treat everyone the same. If you start acting as nice to your foe as your friend, you have lesser guilt or emotional ghosts to fight within you. He alone sees truly who sees God in every creature he does not harm himself or others."

                When thinking about the economy, it's helpful to be able to switch between different levels of resolution. At a low level of resolution, labor (i.e., work hours) and potatoes are just two different kinds of goods that are also inputs in production. They are things that some people own and others value and can use for making other things, and which can be bought and sold in markets. If we think of the free trade position as saying, “Allow mutually agreed-upon trades across borders, without tariffs,” it would oppose barriers to either kind of trade. Saying that one kind of trade isn't okay would seem arbitrary.

                At higher levels of resolution, however, the economic properties of labor and potatoes differ, and the differences are key to a free trader's principled opposition to some outsourcing. The argument is essentially that not all mutually agreed-upon trades are efficient, because the traders who are agreeing don't take into account all the economic consequences of their agreements. A trade can be good for the traders but bad for the world. Whether a given trade is efficient depends on the properties of what's being traded.

                With all this said, a free-trader is unlikely to be against all outsourcing; for some kinds of work that can be effectively contracted on, it is straightforwardly a net gain to hire cheaper labor outside the country or outside the firm. But the special complexities of the employment relationship provide a lot of foundation for being more cautious about decentralized arrangements leading to efficient outcomes in this domain, and some of the issues I've highlighted above are likely to be part of a free-trader's anti-outsourcing argument.'''}
